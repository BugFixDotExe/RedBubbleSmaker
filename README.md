This project extracts ZIP files from a specified folder, searches for EPS files within them, and converts those EPS files into high-quality JPEG images. The converted images are resized to 4500 x 5400 pixels, rendered at 300 DPI, and saved for further use (for example, on print-on-demand platforms like Redbubble).
